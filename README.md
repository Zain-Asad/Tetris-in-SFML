# Tetris
A project made for the Programming Fundamentals Course in my first semester, this is an implementation of the game tetris,
while including a bomb feature, which randomly drops a bomb and clears all the tiles if the tile it lands on matches the color
of the bomb, it is a random event.

This was done using C++ and SFML on Linux, and for building and running, you will need to install sfml:

sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

And to build the project:

main.cpp -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio

For running:

./sfml-app
